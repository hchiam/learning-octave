# Learning Octave

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

The [Octave programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#Octave,_the_language) is mostly like MATLAB, but free and open source (GNU).

Try it online without installing: https://octave-online.net

Mac installation via Homebrew: `brew update; brew install octave`

Run in CLI: `octave`

Clean up CLI prompt (for the session only): `PS1('> ');`

The CLI also has autocomplete (type the few letters and hit tab).

Exit the CLI with `quit` or `exit`.
